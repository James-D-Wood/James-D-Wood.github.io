I\'ve found that the strength of this notebook is that it allows a developer to produce chronilogical summaries of their work and maintain a record of changes in direction and decision making along the course of a project. The weakness of this notebook is that it doesn\'t present a current source of truth for what a project should look like. For this, I maintain a separate strategic notebook that services as up to date documentation on the design, payloads, install plans, etc. for a project that should be shared and circulated. Generally, the daily notebook is personal and the strategic notebook is for collaboration.","sidebar":"workSidebar"},"organization/strategic-notebook":{"id":"organization/strategic-notebook","title":"Strategic Notebook","description":"The purpose of the strategic notebook is to document the design, contracts and technical details of a given product or capability.
