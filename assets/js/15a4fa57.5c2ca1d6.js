My background is in web development, so React Native seemed like the natural choice to get a prototype up and running quickly. The purpose of the app is simply to provide a library of recipes that my friends and family can contribute to and share. It also includes a shopping list generator for weekly grocery runs. The first prototype took a couple of development sessions and my girlfriend and I were pretty happy with the results on our first couple trips to the market. Unfortunately, I need to reinstall the app to our phones every couple days after it expires. TestPilot seems to be the solution to more sustainable long running beta in the iOS ecosystem. Before I take that step though, I want to spend some time comparing what developing with Swift UI feels like.
