# Yearly

As I am approaching 5 years of software development, this is where I am noticing a gap in my process. I want to start measuring my accomplishments, learnings and goals in the scope of years. I am going to jot down a couple ideas for what I could start tracking here.

Here are some ideas to put into practice starting this year:

## Technical Skills Assessment

- **Skills Matrix Review** - Rate myself 1-10 across languages, frameworks, tools that I use and identify opportunities for growth
- **Portfolio Audit** - Review code I wrote 12 months ago vs today; document improvements in style,
architecture, testing
- **Technology Radar** - Assess emerging technologies; decide what to adopt, trial, hold, or retire from
my toolkit

## Career Impact Analysis

- **Project Retrospective** - List all projects/features shipped; categorize by complexity, impact, and
my role
- **Mentorship Inventory** - Who did I mentor/teach? Who mentored me? What knowledge was transferred?
- **Leadership Moments** - Document times I influenced technical decisions, resolved conflicts, or drove
initiatives

## Goal Setting & Planning

- **T-Shaped Skills Planning** - Define my deep expertise area and 2-3 breadth areas to develop
- **Learning Roadmap** - Create quarterly learning goals with specific projects, courses, or certifications
- **Network Mapping** - Identify industry connections to build and communities to join
- **Project Planning** - Identify the personal and open source projects I want to contribute to in the coming year

## Meta-Learning Review

- **Process Evolution** - How did my development workflow, debugging approach, or design thinking change?
- **Mistake Analysis** - Review major bugs/outages; extract systemic improvements for next year
- **Feedback Synthesis** - Compile all performance reviews, peer feedback, and code review comments into
patterns

## Industry Positioning

- **Market Skills Gap Analysis** - Compare my skills against job postings for my target next role
- **Compensation Benchmarking** - Research salary data and plan compensation conversations
