# Sprintly

Every sprint, I want to take a break from the day to day work and do the following:
- **Update Roadmap** - Record updates to the project roadmap and due dates to help organize work for the coming sprint
- **Plan Questions for Leadership Connects/Team Meetings** - Document open questions about the project that need team consensus and discussion
- **Plan Releases** - Create release and post install validation plans for anything I am planning to ship in the coming weeks.
- **Reflect** - Journal on outcomes, accomplishments, learnings and sentiment about the work completed in the current sprint. Take pause for reflection and learning.
