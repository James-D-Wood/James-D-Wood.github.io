# Tech Lead

The following are my thoughts on what it means to be a good tech lead after playing the role for 2 years.

## Responsibilities of the TL

- **Design and Document the High Level Solution** - This becomes the framework within which the other developers on the team can contribute.
- **Refine Stories** - Breaks down the high level problems into small chunks that can be solved by an individual.
- **Review Changes** - Gives opportunity to provide a layer of quality control, provide feedback and mentor other developers.
- **Coordinate Releases** - Provide oversight to ensuring install of changes does not disrupt daily operations of the business.
- **Set the Tone and Team Dynamic** - Create a culture of positivity, honesty, and eagerness to lend a hand. Help others' feel valued for their contributions and at home amongst their team.
- **Help Team Members with Professional Development** - Provide feedback when appropriate to help guide the improvement of the team.
- **Improve the Development Process** - Find solutions to gaps and inefficiencies in the software development process to help improve developer productivity and overall experience.

## What a TL Should Understand

- **Platform and Product Roadmap** - The what and when of the requirements.
- **Architectural Decisions** - The decisions behind how best to meet the requirements.
- **How Value is Defined** - Understand what brings value to your particular business's use case. Not all businesses have the same incentives that drive the value of different engineering practices.
- **Motivations of Others** - Understanding what motivates your stakeholders, partner teams, leadership and team members helps you make good decisions about what to prioritize in your day to day at work. This will give you a framework on how to bring others along and succeed as a team.

## What I struggled with as a TL

### Time Management

In my opinion, this is the Sisyphus' rock of being a tech lead. You are pulled into hours of meetings, asked to consult with other teams, need to drive alignment, respond to emergencies in production, design solutions and facilitate their implementation across a team of engineers with varying predilections, temperaments and talents and often this cannot all be done within an 8 hour work day. This took a while for me to get the hang of and where I feel I really developed was in being intentional with how I planned my days, pushing for clear meeting agendas and cancelling meetings that could not be justified, delegating my responsibilities when needed and getting comfortable saying no to additional asks when I was beyond my bandwidth.

### Saying No

Saying no is an essential skill. It's hard for me to say no - I like the way it feels to be eager to take on a piece of work and help deliver it. But the TL is in a unique position to understand their team's limitations and bandwidth and is responsible for helping to manage in the inflow of work. Where others are eager to say yes, the TL should be comfortable saying no - or at least asking what can be deprioritized in order to say yes. It's the role of the TL to protect their team's time and ensure they are able to deliver the highest priority work.

### Being the Bearer of Bad News

Along the same theme of being willing to disappoint, it is important that a TL has the ability to be candid when things are not going well. Maybe the environment for CI is experiencing an outage and slowing down code review or maybe a feature has quietly undergone scope creep or a number of back and forth requirements changes that have led to inefficient delivery. Being forthcoming about disfunction or risk to timelines helps leadership make more informed decisions.

### Prioritizing the Team

There were a million and one distractions nagging for my attention on a daily basis when I was a TL. A lot of shiny ways to be impactful will present themselves but the difference between being an IC and a TL is that the role requires you put your team's ability to deliver first and foremost. Ticket refinement is not shiny and special, but it is instrumental to ensuring requirements are well understood and your team is empowered to deliver on what is expected. Pairing and code review can be tedious and unseen, but it ensures that deliverables are of high quality and that the team can grow. The team should always come first.

## Advice from other TL's

The following advice was given to me by other tech leads when I first took on the role:

- Learn to balance your old skill set with the new skill set. Your role is now less about shipping code and more about helping facilitate the team's ability to deliver the project correctly.
- Meetings will expand to fill any gaps in your calendar. Block time for deep work and focusing on your team's needs.
- Learn ways to unblock the team and protect their time.
- The hats you will wear will be many. For the team you will be the:
  - Systems Architect and Business Analyst who is responsible for knowing the platform architecture and philosophy and converts business requirements into technical solutions that fit these patterns.
  - Project Planner who is responsible for breaking down the work into small deliverables and who can synchronize the deliverables to be as async/parallel as possible.
  - Still a Software Dev, but Team Lead first. Don't fall into the trap of performing heroics. It is your responsibility to clearly communicate issues and potential solutions.
