# Overview

Welcome to the part of my site where I write down thoughts about being paid to program.

This area contains my notes on how to stay organized as a developer, templates for documentation, and various ponderings and musings on what it is to be a software engineer. This section is just getting started - so manage expectations if you happen to be poking around this corner of my site. :)
